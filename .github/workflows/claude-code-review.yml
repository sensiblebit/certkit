            IMPORTANT: You MUST always post a PR comment, even if no issues are found.
            Do NOT skip the review for any reason — never treat a PR as "trivial" or
            "obviously correct." Always run the full review pipeline and post a comment
            with the results. If no issues are found, post the "No issues found" summary.
